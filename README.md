Rule Based Traffic Congestion Control System

Traffic congestion is a condition on road network that occurs as vehicle increases, and is characterized by slower speeds, longer trip times, and increased vehicular queuing. It effects the economic growth of a country, increases accidents, resource cost and environment pollution. One of the most cost-effective ways, to deal with this problem is by employing traffic control signals at the road intersections. Now-a-days, most signal controls are implemented with either fixed cycle time control or dynamic control. These conventional methods for traffic signal control fails to deal efficiently because they are unable to taking account of the uncertainty associated with traffic flow.
